Here all microsensor and CBASS data can be found. 
1. VBA images
After each CBASS run (8am in the morning the next day) the fragment was removed from the CBASS tank and an images was taken on a colous shart. These images were evaluated by 3 independent people that used an additional Coral Watch colour chart to rate the pigmentation of each fragment from 0%-100%

2.raw_data
The H2O2 and O2 Microsensors were directly connected to a computer during measurements and the signal and time were recorded every second. The raw microsensor data was saved as a word file and transfered into excel. Here comments during the measurement are part of the data file.

3. cleaned_data
To clean the data from comments and double data pooints were removed. Afterwards the interference detection was performed to remove wrong singals from the data set.
