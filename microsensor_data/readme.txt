Microsensor data
Here the data of the Microsensor measurements can be found.
Microsensor data can be found in the raw version (raw_data) and in the cleaned version (cleaned_data) where interferences were already removed.
Under the folder Microsensor calibration folder the Excel tables containing the calibration before each CBASS run can be found.
All R scripts used for the figures and the interference analysis can be found in the R script folder.
